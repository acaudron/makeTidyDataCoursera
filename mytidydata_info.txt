Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (inTimeBodyAcceleration-XYZ and inTimeGravityAcceleration-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (inTimeBodyAccelerationJerkSignal-XYZ and inTimeBodyAngularVelocityJerkSignal-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (inTimeBodyAccelerationMagnitude, inTimeGravityAccelerationMagnitude, inTimeBodyAccelerationJerkSignalMagnitude, inTimeBodyAngularVelocityMagnitude, inTimeBodyAngularVelocityJerkSignalMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAcceleration-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerkSignal-XYZ, frequencyBodyAngularVelocity-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerkSignalMagnitude, frequencyBodyAngularVelocityMagnitude, frequencyBodyAngularVelocityJerkSignalMagnitude. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were kept from the input dataset are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Notes:
Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
No information is available about the unit of the variables. 

Those variables have been averaged by activities and by subject.
